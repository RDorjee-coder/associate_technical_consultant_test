1. How long did you take to complete the technical test?

It took me around an hour and 45 minutes to complete the first part of the test beacause i encountered an error
with accessing the file and had to browse through various resources to try and get the answer,
and only around 20-30 minutes to complete the second part.

2. Was it easy or challenging? Which parts of the test was easy, and which was challenging?

The technical test was challenging for me in the first part because I had limited
familiarity with the Flask framework, and I encountered a 500 internal server error
when trying to send requests to `url = 'http://api.icndb.com/jokes/random/'`.

The second part, however, was not difficult because I am very familiar with Python and Pandas,
which made it easy to work with the file. I also had no trouble setting up my GitHub repository
and using Git commands during the test.

3. What resources did you use to learn how to solve the test (i.e. Google, forums, books)?

I primarily used pycharm CE as my text editor and used the Flask Documentation, Pandas documentation,
searched for sample codes on GitHub repositories, browsed through stackoverflow, watched few youtube videos,
and employed debugging techniques with breakpoints during the test.

4. Briefly describe the process that you went through to find the solution for the problem.

During the test, I primarily used the Flask Documentation to understand and solve challenges.
I also explored sample codes from GitHub repositories, utilized debugging techniques with breakpoints
to pinpoint errors in the code, browsed Stack Overflow for solutions to similar issues,
and experimented with dummy values in arrays to ensure error-free code.
Additionally, I attempted to resolve issues with different URLs but encountered
401 unauthorized errors along the way. In the end, I experimented with different URLs
(url = 'https://official-joke-api.appspot.com/jokes/random?category=chucknorris') to fetch the data and
successfully resolved the issue, achieving the desired JSON output

For the second part, I noticed that the `transaction` column was missing in the `data.xlsx` file,
and the task required calculating sales and transactions per 15-minute time bucket. To address this,
I created an additional column named "transaction" and populated it with random values ranging from 0 to 100,
matching the length of the dataframe. Finally i was able to produce a result in a new csv file.

5. Are there any other key experiences/notes that you would like us to know in regard to your
experience in taking the test?

I have covered all essential aspects of my test experience, offering brief insights into the challenges
faced and the solutions applied. Overall, I found the test questions themselves to be fairly straightforward.
